<h1>About me Alexis ✋ </h1>

Hi ! <br>
- <h4>How i am ?</h4>
I am Alexis, I am 21 years old at the time of writing these lines! <br>
Novice in programming, I had initially studied in a design office (use of CAD software), before choosing to convert to IT, <br>
(a field that has always plagued me) following the COVID pandemic. <br>

- <h4>How do i learn programming ?</h4>
I learn programing at my first "piscine" in the school 42 of Lyon. <br>
I continue to learn thanks to the internet and the different books on the subject. <br>

- <h4>What I would like in the future</h4>
The big question, I would like to pass my 2nd "piscine" at 42 Lyon, and I will see later. <br>
I would probably specialize in video games or cybersecurity (or maybe something else if I'm in love with it) <br>
And I would really like to open my own company <br>

- <h4>My hobbies</h4>
Computers aside, I like :

- Video Games 🎮
- Role play games 🎲
- Reding 📘
- Long Walk Outside 🚶‍♂️(Yeah Dev go outside sometimes)
